This project uses the Flask framework to build a simple web application that provides a command-line style chat interface. The front-end is designed using HTML and CSS to simulate the appearance of a command line, and JavaScript handles user input and displays responses. The back-end Flask application processes the user's input requests and echoes the entered content. The entire application can be deployed via Docker containerization.
